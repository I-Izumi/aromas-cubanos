---

## Executive Summary

Aromas Cubanos is a chain of premium coffee shops and cigar lounges based in Cuba. Our vision is to create a unique space where customers can enjoy the rich flavors of Cuban coffee alongside the finest Cuban cigars. The concept blends the vibrant coffee culture with the heritage of world-renowned Cuban cigars, offering an exclusive experience that caters to both locals and tourists.

Each Aromas Cubanos location will feature an indoor cigar lounge where patrons can indulge in smoking high-quality cigars while enjoying their coffee. For non-smoking customers or those who prefer a smoke-free environment, our outdoor seating area provides a serene space to savor the same premium coffee without exposure to smoke. 

By merging two of Cuba’s most celebrated exports—coffee and cigars—Aromas Cubanos aims to create a memorable cultural experience that attracts both connoisseurs and casual visitors.

## Business Opportunity

Cuba’s iconic products—coffee and cigars—are known worldwide for their exceptional quality. Despite the demand for both, there is a lack of spaces that combine these experiences in a comfortable, stylish, and customer-oriented way. Aromas Cubanos fills this gap by creating a welcoming environment for both cigar aficionados and coffee lovers.

**Why Aromas Cubanos?**

- **Premium Cuban Coffee**: We serve locally sourced, hand-roasted Cuban coffee beans, known for their rich flavors and bold aromas.
- **Fine Cuban Cigars**: Our cigar menu offers a selection of premium Cuban cigars from well-known brands like Cohiba, Montecristo, and Partagás.
- **Dual Environment**: Our establishments cater to both smokers and non-smokers, offering separate indoor and outdoor spaces that suit everyone’s preferences.
- **Authentic Cuban Experience**: Our cafes are designed with a touch of Cuban culture, featuring art, décor, and music that capture the soul of Cuba.

## Market Research

### Target Audience

- **Cigar Aficionados**: Both locals and tourists who enjoy the ritual and experience of smoking a fine Cuban cigar.
- **Coffee Enthusiasts**: People who appreciate high-quality coffee, especially those seeking the authenticity of Cuban beans.
- **Tourists**: Visitors to Cuba who want to experience the country's two most famous products—coffee and cigars—in one unique setting.
- **Locals**: Cubans looking for a social space to relax, have a coffee, and enjoy the company of friends, or to conduct informal meetings.

### Competitive Landscape

There are few establishments in Cuba that provide an integrated coffee and cigar experience. While some cigar lounges exist, they are typically standalone and do not offer the same focus on premium coffee as Aromas Cubanos. Similarly, coffee shops in Cuba are not usually designed to accommodate cigar smokers. By combining both products in a single location, Aromas Cubanos will stand out as a unique offering in the market.

### Market Trends

1. **Growing Cigar Tourism**: Cuba’s tourism industry benefits from visitors seeking authentic experiences, and cigars are a significant draw for many. Our shops will serve as a destination for cigar tourism.
2. **Global Demand for Premium Coffee**: The specialty coffee market is growing worldwide, and Cuban coffee is recognized as a premium product that appeals to discerning consumers.

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

1. **Coffee Sales**: We will sell a range of coffee beverages, from espresso and cappuccino to traditional Cuban cafecito. Beans will also be available for purchase for customers to enjoy at home.
2. **Cigar Sales**: Customers can purchase cigars for immediate enjoyment in the lounge or take them home.
3. **Food and Pastries**: We will offer a small selection of Cuban pastries and light snacks to complement the coffee and cigar experience.
4. **Merchandise**: Branded items such as cigar cutters, lighters, coffee mugs, and t-shirts will be available for sale.

### Pricing Strategy

Aromas Cubanos will position itself as a premium brand, offering high-quality products at mid-to-high-end prices. Given the exclusivity of our Cuban cigars and coffee, we will price competitively within the luxury market. Tourists, especially, are willing to pay a premium for authentic Cuban experiences.

## Location and Expansion Plan

We plan to open multiple locations in popular cities and tourist destinations across Cuba. Initial locations will be:

1. **Havana**: The capital city is a prime destination for tourists and locals alike. A centrally located café in Havana will serve as our flagship store.
2. **Varadero**: As a leading tourist hub with luxury resorts, Varadero is an ideal market for cigar and coffee lovers.
3. **Santiago de Cuba**: Known for its vibrant culture, this city will cater to both locals and international visitors.

Once we establish a strong presence in these locations, we will look to expand to other major cities and possibly international destinations where Cuban cigars and coffee are in demand.

## Operations Plan

### Café Layout

1. **Indoor Cigar Lounge**: A designated indoor area with proper ventilation and an atmosphere of luxury where customers can smoke cigars and enjoy their coffee.
2. **Outdoor Seating**: A separate outdoor area for non-smokers who prefer to enjoy their coffee in a smoke-free environment. This area will be adorned with Cuban-style patio furniture and plants to create a relaxing ambiance.

### Staffing

Each location will be staffed by trained baristas, cigar experts (tabaqueros), and customer service personnel who can provide a personalized experience for each guest.

### Suppliers

- **Coffee Beans**: We will partner with local Cuban coffee farms for a consistent supply of high-quality beans.
- **Cigars**: We will establish direct relationships with Cuban cigar manufacturers to offer a wide selection of hand-rolled cigars.

## Marketing Strategy

1. **Tourist Partnerships**: We will collaborate with tour operators, hotels, and travel agencies to offer package deals, promotions, and exclusive experiences for their guests.
2. **Social Media Campaigns**: A strong online presence will be maintained through Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, showcasing the lifestyle and experiences at Aromas Cubanos.
3. **Cultural Events**: Regular events, such as cigar rolling demonstrations, coffee tasting sessions, and live Cuban music nights, will draw both tourists and locals.
4. **Merchandise and Online Sales**: We will set up an e-commerce platform to sell our branded merchandise and select products like coffee beans and cigars internationally.

## Financial Projections

Initial funding for Aromas Cubanos will be used for:

1. **Leasing and Renovation**: Securing premium locations and designing spaces that reflect the Cuban aesthetic.
2. **Inventory**: Purchasing high-quality coffee beans and cigars.
3. **Marketing**: Initial advertising campaigns to raise awareness and attract customers.

We expect to break even within the first 18-24 months of operation, with profitability achieved as the brand expands to new locations. Revenues will be driven by coffee and cigar sales, supplemented by food, merchandise, and events.

## Conclusion

Aromas Cubanos brings together two of Cuba’s most beloved traditions: coffee and cigars. By offering a unique, high-end experience in a welcoming and culturally rich environment, we will attract both locals and tourists who seek the best that Cuba has to offer. With our blend of premium products, exceptional service, and strategic location, we are confident in Aromas Cubanos’ potential to become a leader in Cuba’s hospitality market.
